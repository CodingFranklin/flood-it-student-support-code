FloodIt! Student Support Code

Revision: Fall 2024

[Question 1] What function roughly fits that graph? Hint: possibilities are 
[Question 2] What is the time complexity of your flood() function based on analyzing its code? Answer the question in your write-up and write the complexity as a line of comment in your code above the function.
[Question 3] Does your analysis match up with what you see in the graph?
If not, double check your analysis.
[Question 4] What data structures did you use (linked lists, arraysâ€¦) ? Is the time complexity of your flood function the best it can be or can you do better? Why?
