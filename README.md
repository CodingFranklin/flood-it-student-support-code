FloodIt! Student Support Code

Revision: Fall 2024

[Question 1] What function roughly fits that graph? 
f(n) = n^2

[Question 2] What is the time complexity of your flood() function based on analyzing its code? Answer the question in your write-up and write the complexity as a line of comment in your code above the function.
Overall, it will be O(n * n * n) = O(n^3) 

[Question 3] Does your analysis match up with what you see in the graph?
If not, double check your analysis.
Yes

[Question 4] What data structures did you use (linked lists, arraysâ€¦)? Is the time complexity of your flood function the best it can be or can you do better? Why?
I have used Linked Lists, Queue, and HashSet. I think the flood function is the best it can be.

[Question 5] What is the time complexity of your alternative implementation? Comment the function with its time complexity in your code and write down the time complexity in your write-up.
Overall, it will be O(n + n * (4 + 1)) = O(6n) = O(n)
